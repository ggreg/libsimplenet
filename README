libsimplenet is a simple network library on top of libev.

At the moment, it is written and tested on linux amd64. This version supports
custom callbacks for logging, client negotiation after accept(), and request
processing.

Currently it only supports IPv4 and no custom structures (work in progress).

It is not the role of this library to handle configuration and daemonization.
